We describe in\ndetail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau\nsearch. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems,\nthere is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of\nsatisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make\ndetailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the\naverage gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score\nand average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search.

Because the cut\npredicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be\nlearned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning\nsystems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of\na space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to\ngenerate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and\nthen make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of\nlearning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to\nbe a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate\nthe difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually\ncaused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion,\nthe analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that\nlearning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be\nrestricted to purely declarative logic languages.",

In addition to the minimum description length principle, other\nbackground knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more\nappropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate\nSUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data\nand to discover structural concepts important to the domain.

We define the degree of\nbelief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show\nthat when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary\npredicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N\ngrows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can\nuse a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief.
